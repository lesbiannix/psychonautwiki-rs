# AI Session Management Directory

This directory contains all files related to AI-assisted development, session restoration, and progress tracking for the `psychonautwiki-rs` project.

## Structure

- `prompts/` — Session prompts and context for each work session
- `progress/` — Progress tracking files (current status, next steps, completed tasks)
- `analysis/` — Codebase analysis, feature mapping, technical decisions
- `README.md` — This file

## Usage
- Before each session, review `progress/current-status.md` and `progress/next-steps.md`.
- After each significant change, update progress files and save session context in `prompts/`.
- Commit changes with `📝 Update progress tracking`.
