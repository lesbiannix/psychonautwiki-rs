# Next Steps

1. Refactor persistence.rs for robust JSON save/load (remove unwraps, add error handling, atomic writes)
2. Integrate persistence with TUI (status bar feedback for save/load errors)
3. Write and run tests for persistence logic (including error/corruption cases)
4. Document all new features and update progress files after each change
5. (Then) Expand TUI navigation, polish UI, and add accessibility improvements
