# Next Steps

1. Integrate persistence with TUI (status bar feedback for save/load errors)
2. Document all new features and update progress files after each change
3. Expand TUI navigation, polish UI, and add accessibility improvements
4. Plan for future enhancements (e.g., SQLite support, advanced error recovery)
